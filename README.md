The computer is supposed to guess a whole number.
The player will be given 10 chances to guess the number guessed by the computer. If the number guessed by the user matches with that of the computer, the player wins. Otherwise, the computer should indicate whether the guess made by the player is higher or lower than that of the computer.
If the player types anything other than an integer (say by accident), the computer will ignore that input and ask the player to input again.
The computer prints “congratulations <name of the player>, you won” or “sorry <name of the player> you lost” depending on whether the player won or lost the game. Here the <name of the player> refers to the name entered by the player at the start.
